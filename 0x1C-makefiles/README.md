# 0x1C. C - Makefiles
The project is about the makefile. This brings us to the question, what is a makefile?
and its uses.
- The “make” program in Linux is used to compile and manage a set of source code applications and files
- It also allows developers to install and gather a range of apps via the terminal. 
- It also controls and cuts down on the amount of time necessary for compilation

Apart from the defination, we will also expolre on how to install and use makefile in our daily life as software engineers.The bellow listed objectives and resources will be handy in our quest for exploration and also guide our expectation.

## Resources
- [Makefile ](https://www3.nd.edu/~zxu2/acms60212-40212/Makefile.pdf )
- [Installing the make utility](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-make-on-ubuntu/ )
- [make-official documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/ )

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Learning Objectives
- What are make, Makefiles
- When, why and how to use Makefiles
- What are rules and how to set and use them
- What are explicit and implicit rules
- What are the most common / useful rules
- What are variables and how to set and use them

### Files
In the following tasks, we are going to use [these files](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x1B.c). We want to compile these only.

## TASK:
Create your first Makefile.

### Requirements:

- name of the executable: school
- rules: all
    - The all rule builds your executable
- variables: none
